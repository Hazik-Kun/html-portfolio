<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an avid fan of flavoured tea and green tea, and I prefer to keep my coffee consumption on the down-low. In my free time, you'll find me exploring my love for sneakers, tech gadgets, and binge-watching western and eastern TV series, as well as indulging in some casual-to-hardcore anime and manga/manhwa/webtoon.</p>
<p>I've been working in HR as recruiter for the past 4 years but I guess it's time for me to add some new skills to my arsenal, this is the first step I'm taking to go into Software Engineering.</p>
