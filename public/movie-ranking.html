<h1>The Best Movies According to Amir Azid
    <h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>

<hr>

        <h3>1. John Wick 3: Parabellum</h3>
            <p>This is the only movie that I've watched 3 times in the theatre. Sooo worth it</p>
        <h3>2. Shin Ultraman</h3>
            <p>Ultraman was a hero to lots of 90s kids, other than Kamen Rider and anime characters. Howevers as time goes by, more and more Ultraman series feels like a throwaway just to sell toys to kids instead of focuing on simplicity.</p>
        <h3>3. 3 Ninjas</h3>
            <p>Was a childhood movie for me. I remembered that I used to have a huge crush on the female characters. Used to watch this on Sunday.</p>
